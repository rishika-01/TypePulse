    "Anushree was born on December 24th, 2005. She comes from Kundapura, but she often visits Jigani too. Back in school, she was a state 10th rank holder in her Class X exams. Now, she is pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Anushree is known for being a funny, silly woman who can make anyone laugh with her random jokes. Besides that, she absolutely loves fish and never misses a chance to enjoy a seafood meal.", 
    "B Sai Sahithi was born on January 4th, 2006. She is proudly Telugu and officially the GOAT of Indiranagar. In fact, she lives just 65 steps away from college. Yes, someone counted. She’s a master chef who can cook up anything from Maggi to masterpieces. If Shakespeare were alive today, she’d easily be his favorite person, probably because she talks in plot twists and cooks in metaphors.",
    "Nandan was born on June 16th, 2005, and he studies ECE, which basically means he dreams about antennas 24/7. His love for antennas is so serious, some say his Wi-Fi connects faster just by standing near him. Karthikeya sir is his official 'best man in life,' no wedding needed. Nandan is also a hardcore D-Boss fan, but don’t worry—he’s still an absolute gem of a human, even if his ringtone might be a Darshan dialogue",
    "Tanisha was born on November 25th, 2005, and comes from Kundapura. She is usually found dying over certificate designs, switching between Photoshop and Canva like it’s an Olympic sport. She’s proudly short, but her stress is tall enough to reach the cloud. Tanisha studies AIML, but half her life goes into fixing alignment issues. Sometimes she’s not sure if her name is Tanisha Prakash or just TANISHA in bold, capital letters, and honestly, neither are we.",
    "Vageesh was born on May 13th, 2005. He’s never really gone anywhere except Srinagar, but honestly, his passport is just his laptop screen. He started as the legend of Mechanical Engineering but then did a software upgrade to AIML. Now he’s the web dev god of BMSCE, fixing bugs faster than people can find the Ctrl Z shortcut. His screen time is officially longer than the lifetime screen time of a 30 yearold and that’s just this week."
